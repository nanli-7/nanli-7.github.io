#OpenStreetMap Data Case Study

## Map Area

San-Jose, CA, USA 

* <https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/san-jose_california/>

San Jose is the largest city within the Bay Area and earns the nickname "Capital of Silicon Valley". Many technology
company headquarters are located in this area. I'm interested in finding unique features of the city map.

## Assessing Quality of Map Data
Before analyzing the whole set of the database, I'd like to take a small sample of the datafile to assess the quality of the data. After processing the sample data, I found that the overall quality of dataset is fair, and in order to improve consistency and accuracy, some problematic data needs to be cleaned. Data quality problems are:

* Inconsistent postal codes format(CA 94035, 95014-1657, 95070)
* Inconsistent street type name, street name abbreviation (Rd, Road; Cir,Circle)
* Tags in second level of 'way' tags, data from Tiger GPS is divided into different categories for searching usage. (county, name_base, name_type)

```
		<tag k="name" v="Lafayette Street"/>
		<tag k="oneway" v="yes"/>
		<tag k="highway" v="primary"/>
		<tag k="maxspeed" v="40 mph"/>
		<tag k="tiger:county" v="Santa Clara, CA"/>
		<tag k="tiger:name_base" v="Lafayette"/>
		<tag k="tiger:name_type" v="St"/>
```

## Data Cleaning

Before outputting the OSM XML data into CSV files, perform the data cleaning first to improve data quality. Data cleaning includes two steps: update postal code and update street name. 

#### Update Postal Code
In the original datafile, postal code format is different, some entries have state abbreviation heading,  many entries have four-digit code extension. We'll standardize the data into five-digit format first.

```
postcode_re = re.compile(r'[0-9]{5}')

def update_postcode(postcode):
    m = postcode_re.search(postcode)
    try:
        postcode = m.group()
    except:
        pass
    return postcode
```

#### Update Street Name
Use regular expression to find street type first, if it is in abbreviation, change it into full street type. For Example: 'Blvd' is updated to 'Boulevard'.

```
street_type_re = re.compile(r'\b\S+\.?$', re.IGNORECASE)
def update_name(name, mapping):
    m = street_type_re.search(name)
    better_name = name
    if m:
        if m.group() in mapping.keys():
            better_street_type = mapping[m.group()]
            better_name = street_type_re.sub(better_street_type, name)
    return better_name
    return name
```
After clean up the problematic data, the OSM XML file will be parsed into five CSV files follow the schema from schema.py. Then the data will be imported into SQLite3 database. 

## Statistical Overview of Dataset
This part contains basic statistics about the database, such as file size, number of nodes, ways, etc. 

#### File Sizes

File Name | File Size
----------|---------
san-jose_california.osm | 284.8 MB
san_jose_california.db | 153 MB 
nodes.csv | 107.2 MB 
nodes_tags.csv | 2.6 MB
ways.csv | 10.1 MB
ways_nodes.csv | 35.5 MB 
ways_tags.csv | 21.3 MB

#### Number of Nodes
```
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nodes;
```
1285767


#### Number of Ways

```
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ways;
```
171036

#### Number of Unique Users

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(e.uid))          
FROM (SELECT uid FROM nodes 
      UNION ALL 
      SELECT uid FROM ways) e;
```
1245


#### Number of Shops  
```
SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key = 'shop';
```
1908

#### Top 10 Types of Shops
```
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key = 'shop'
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Type of Shop | Count
-----|-----
car_repair|169
supermarket|147
convenience|139
beauty|113
hairdresser|110
clothes|105
car|46
bakery|41
alcohol|39
department_store|39


## City Map Exploration

Some interesting findings have been discovered in this section. 

#### Top 10 Cities by Count
```
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key = 'city'
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
City | Count
-----|------
Sunnyvale|3396
San Jose|733
Morgan Hill|373
Santa Clara|301
Saratoga|231
San Jos√©|115
Milpitas|94
Cupertino|56
Los Gatos|49
Campbell|47

#### Top 10 Postal Code Area by Count
```
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags 
      UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key='postcode'
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Postal Code | Count
------|------
95014|9920
95037|386
95070|236
94087|211
94086|201
95051|164
95054|98
95125|92
95127|90
95035|89

Postal code 95014 refers to city of Cupertino, but if we count the number of city appeared in tags, city of Cupertino has been tagged for only 56 times. Similarly, for city of sunnyvale, postal code ranges from 94085 to 94089, while under tag of city the appearance number is 3396. This is due to the incompleteness of data. 

#### Top 10 Appearing Amenities
```
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key = 'amenity'
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Amenity | Count
------|------
parking|1808
restaurant|939
school|537
fast_food|475
place_of_worship|343
cafe|238
fuel|233
bench|198
toilets|183
bicycle_parking|182

### Popular Fast Food
```
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as num
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags JOIN 
      (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags 
      WHERE value='fast_food' UNION ALL 
      SELECT  DISTINCT(id) FROM ways_tags
      WHERE value='fast_food') i
    ON tags.id=i.id
WHERE tags.key='cuisine'
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Cuisine|Count
----|-----
burger|85
sandwich|70
mexican|43
pizza|29
ice_cream|23
chicken|16
vietnamese|16
chinese|12
american|7
indian|6

### Popular Cuisines 

```
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as num
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags JOIN 
      (SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM nodes_tags 
      WHERE value='restaurant' UNION ALL 
      SELECT  DISTINCT(id) FROM ways_tags
      WHERE value='restaurant') i
    ON tags.id=i.id
WHERE tags.key='cuisine'
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

-----|-------
mexican|82
chinese|72
vietnamese|67
pizza|56
japanese|41
american|35
italian|33
indian|32
thai|26
sushi|23



## Additional Ideas
* The above results have revealed the incompleteness of data, for example, some road tags may only have postal code entries, or may only have city data without postal code. So, based on the given postal code data, it is possible to update the street city values. 

```
Postal Code & City Mappings: 

{ '95014':'Cupertino',
  '95037':'Morgan Hill',
  '95070':'Saratoga'
  ...
}
```
* Parking is the largest number amenity, we may also further analyze the correlation between number of parking and street type. 

## Conclusion
Through analysis of dataset, it is clear that postal code and city data is not consistent, which is due to the incompleteness of the map data. We can update the city tag by its postal code value. And other interesting study topics are: cuisine popularity in different cities, relationship between number of parking place and types of street, etc.
